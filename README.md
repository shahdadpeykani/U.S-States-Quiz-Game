# U.S-States-Quiz-Game
This repository contains a Python-based quiz game that helps players learn the U.S. states by location. The game uses the Turtle graphics library to display a map of the United States, and players are prompted to guess the names of the states. The game keeps track of correctly guessed states and displays them on the map. If the player exits the game before guessing all 50 states, a list of the states they missed is saved to a CSV file for further practice. The project utilizes the Turtle and Pandas libraries for graphical display and data handling, respectively.
